/**
 Continue the topic "Interactive Animations" in https://www.objc.io/issues/12-animations/interactive-animations/ , use UIViewPropertyAnimator
 introduced in iOS 10 to implement control pane open/close interactive animation with the style of UIView Animation. UIViewPropertyAnimator is
 additive except that inited with UISpringTimingParameters and initialVelocity isn't (0,0).
